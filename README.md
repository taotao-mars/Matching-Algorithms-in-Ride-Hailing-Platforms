# Matching-Algorithms-in-Ride-Hailing-Platforms
As driverless vehicles emerge and become more mainstream, transportation is undergoing radical changes. We consider scenarios that involve a combination of human-driven and driverless vehicles. We approach the problem from the perspective of the ride sharing operator, that is interested in routing the cars to the passengers in an optimal fashion. We explore the complexity in defining a meaningful objective itself and propose a family of routing and ride-sharing algorithms. We also present detailed empirical results for various scenarios and discuss the differences between the performance of different algorithms.
